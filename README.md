# About
Minecraft Spigot plugin that lets players use shears to remove ownership of their tamed animals.

In Vanilla Minecraft, once you tame an animal, it is yours forever. If you breed two animals owned by another player, the offspring also become property of the parent animals' owner, not you. This can be problematic on multiplayer servers, especially when trying to open a pet shop. To address this, I've created this plugin! Now, the owner of any tamed animal can right-click on it with shears to release it from ownership, allowing someone else to tame it. If you attempt to release an animal you don't own, a chat message will appear displaying the owner's name. Most users will primarily use this plugin to release cats and wolves, but it can also release ownership of parrots, horses, donkeys, mules, llamas, and camels. It does not interfere with the ability to remove wolf armor with shears; simply remove the armor first, then release ownership with a second click.

# Usage
1. Drop the `RemovePetOwner-1.0.jar` in your server plugins directory.
2. Launch or reload your server.
3. Right-click with shears on a tamed animal!
